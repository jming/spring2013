 # The throwing model takes as input a target location.  
 # It proceeds as follows:
 # (1) Convert the dartboard location into a geometric location in polar coordinates.
 # (2) Convert the polar coordinates into rectangular coordinates.
 # (3) Add bias and noise to the rectangular coordinates.
 # (4) Convert back into polar coordinates.
 # (5) Convert back into a dartboard location, and return.
 #
 # The bias is a constant factor added to each throw, modeling consistent
 # tendencies of a thrower to aim incorrectly.
 # The noise is an added jitter factor randomly added to a throw, modeling
 # tendencies of a thrower to wobble.
 #
 # A thrower is therefore characterized by the bias and the degree of wobble.
 # These are captured in the bias and wobble variables, which are set randomly
 # by init_thrower. 
 #
 # A simpler throwing model is also provided.
 # In this model, the wedge hit is distributed as follows: 
 # With probability 0.1: two to the left of the target wedge
 # With probability 0.2: one to the left of the target wedge
 # With probability 0.4: the target wedge
 # With probability 0.2: one to the right of the target wedge
 # With probability 0.1: two to the right of the target wedge
 # 
 # The ring hit is similarly distributed.  Let the target ring be i.
 # An error from -2 to +2 is selected, with probabilities as above.
 # The result ring is abs(i+error).
