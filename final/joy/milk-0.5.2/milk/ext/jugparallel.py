============
Jug Parallel
============

These are some functions that make it easier to take advantage of `jug
<http://luispedro.org/software/jug>`__ to perform tasks in parallel.

All of the functions in this module return a jug.Task object and are usable
with the ``CompoundTask`` interface in jug.

None of this will make sense unless you understand and have used jug.

def nfoldcrossvalidation(features, labels, **kwargs):

    A jug Task that perform n-foldcrossvalidation

    N-fold cross validation is inherently parallel. This function returns a
    ``jug.Task`` which performs n-fold crossvalidation which jug can
    parallelise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features : sequence of features
    labels : sequence
    kwargs : any
        This will be passed down to ``milk.nfoldcrossvalidation``

    Returns
    -------
    jug_task : a jug.Task
        A Task object

    --------
    milk.nfoldcrossvalidation : The same functionality as a "normal" function
    jug.CompoundTask : This function can be used as argument to CompoundTask

def kmeans_select_best(features, ks, repeats=1, method='AIC', R=None, **kwargs):
    '''
    assignments_centroids = kmeans_select_best(features, ks, repeats=1, method='AIC', R=None, **kwargs)

    Perform ``repeats`` calls to ``kmeans`` for each ``k`` in ``ks``, select
    the best one according to ``method.``

    Note that, unlike a raw ``kmeans`` call, this is *always deterministic*
    even if ``R=None`` (which is interpreted as being equivalent to setting it
    to a fixed value). Otherwise, the jug paradigm would be broken as different
    runs would give different results.

    Parameters
    ----------
    features : array-like
        2D array
    ks : sequence of integers
        These will be the values of ``k`` to try
    repeats : integer, optional
        How many times to attempt each k (default: 1).
    method : str, optional
        Which method to use. Must be one of 'AIC' (default) or 'BIC'.
    R : random number source, optional
        Even you do not pass a value, the result will be deterministic. This is
        different from the typical behaviour of ``R``, but, when using jug,
        reproducibility is often but, when using jug, reproducibility is often
        a desired feature.
    kwargs : other options
        These are passed transparently to ``kmeans``

    Returns
    -------
    assignments_centroids : jug.Task
        jug.Task which is the result of the best (as measured by ``method``)
        kmeans clustering.
