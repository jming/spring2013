Machine learning in Python

Toplevel functions
------------------
- nfoldcrossvalidation: n-fold crossvalidation
- defaultclassifier: get a general purpose classifier
- kmeans: kmeans clustering

Modules
-------
- supervised
- unsupervised
- measures

Example
-------

::

    features = np.random.randn(100,20)
    features[:50] *= 2
    labels = np.repeat((0,1), 50)

    classifier = milk.defaultclassifier()
    model = classifier.train(features, labels)
    new_label = model.apply(np.random.randn(100))
    new_label2 = model.apply(np.random.randn(100)*2)

Could not import submodules (exact error was: %s).

There are many reasons for this error the most common one is that you have
either not built the packages or have built (using `python setup.py build`) or
installed them (using `python setup.py install`) and then proceeded to test
milk **without changing the current directory**.

Try installing and then changing to another directory before importing milk.
