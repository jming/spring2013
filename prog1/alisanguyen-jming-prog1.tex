We chose to implement Prim's Algorithm because 
\item Growth Rates
\newline
\newline
Initially, our data for the 0 dimension exhibiited a similar growth rate to the other dimensions, which we at first naively generalized as correct. However, upon further inspection of our implementation of a heap, we found that it was not in fact behaving as originally planned.
